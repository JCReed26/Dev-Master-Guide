you are working in a Vite + React project that uses DaisyUI for styling 

your task:
1. setup simple navigation bar using only daisyui components (no raw tailwind classes or custom css).
2. create a simple two-page setup:
- Home Page
- About Page 
3. implement navigation so users can switch between these pages 
4. add clear code comments showing where and how additional pages can be added later
5. keep the structure clean and beginner-friendly, so others can easiy extend it 

deliverables:
- a navbar component built with daisyui 
- a basic routing setup (react-router-dom) connecting Home and About
- example placeholders for content in each page
- block comments showing how to add more pages to both the router and nav bar

remember: 
- use daisyui components instead of raw tailwind or custom css
- keep the code well-organized and commented for clarity
